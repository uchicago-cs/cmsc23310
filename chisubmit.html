<h1>Using chisubmit<a class="headerlink" href="#using-chisubmit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We use a command-line tool called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chisubmit</span></code> to manage student repositories and grading in this course. chisubmit will
also be used to handle your registration for the final project. This page contains instructions on some of the common
tasks you&#8217;ll have to do with chisubmit.</p>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h2>Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, choose an empty directory in your CS home directory on which to do your CMSC 23310 work on. Inside that directory, run the following command on a CS Linux machine (or by SSH&#8217;ing into linux.cs.uchicago.edu):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit init
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When prompted for your &#8220;chisubmit username&#8221; and &#8220;chisubmit password&#8221;, just use your CNetID and password. Once you have entered your username and password, you will be shown a list of courses you belong to in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chisubmit</span></code>. If CMSC 23310 does not appear in them, you registration information may not have been added to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chisubmit</span></code> (if you registered for the class recently, please try again in 24 hours; if not, please contact your instructor).</p>
<p>After <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chisubmit</span> <span class="pre">init</span></code> runs successfully, you will be able to run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chisubmit</span></code> commands from inside that directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="registering-for-a-programming-assignment">
<h2>Registering for a programming assignment<a class="headerlink" href="#registering-for-a-programming-assignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To be able to submit a programming assignment, you will first need to register for it. For example, to register
for the first programming assignment:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment register pa1
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="registering-for-the-final-project">
<h2>Registering for the final project<a class="headerlink" href="#registering-for-the-final-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you will be working individually on the project, then you must run this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment register project
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should use the individual repository that was created for you at the start of the quarter.</p>
<p>However, most (if not all) of you will be working in teams for the final project. If you will be working in a team, you will need to register for the project before a joint repository is created for you. If you are working in a pair, then each student must run this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment register project --partner MY_PARTNER_CNETID
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MY_PARTNER_CNETID</span></code> should be replaced with the CNetID of the partner of the student who is running the above command.</p>
<p>If you are working in teams of three, then you much each run this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment register project --partner MY_PARTNER_CNETID --partner MY_OTHER_PARTNER_CNETID
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will be assigned a team name which will be composed of your CNetIDs. You can see the list of teams you are in with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student team list
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And you can use this command to check the status of your team (and, in particular, whether every partner has completed their part of the registration):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student team show TEAMNAME
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(where TEAMNAME should be replaced by your team name)</p>
<p>Once all team members have registered for the project, a GitLab repository will be created for you. Please note that there is usually a lag of 10 minutes between completing your registration and having your repository created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="making-a-submission">
<h2>Making a submission<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-submission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you have registered for a programming assignment or for the project, you will be able to make submissions for it.</p>
<div class="section" id="selecting-the-commit-you-want-to-submit">
<h3>Selecting the commit you want to submit<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-the-commit-you-want-to-submit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To submit an assignment for grading, you first need to select the specific commit you want us to grade. Commits in git are identified by a SHA-1 hash, and look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>4eac77c9f11dfb101dbbbe3e9f2df07c40f9b2f5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can see the list of commits in your repository by running the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git log
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, if you simply want to get the SHA-1 hash of the latest commit in your <cite>master</cite> branch, you can just run this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git rev-parse master
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="making-the-submission">
<h3>Making the submission<a class="headerlink" href="#making-the-submission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve identified the commit you want to submit, you need to run the following <strong>BEFORE THE DEADLINE</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment submit &lt;cnet-or-team&gt; &lt;assignment-id&gt; &lt;commit-sha&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;cnet-or-team&gt;</span></code> is either your CNetID (if you are submitting a programming assignment) or your team identifier (if you
are submitting the final project). Your team identifier will be the same as your repository name (typically your CNetIDs separated by hyphens).</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;assignment-id&gt;</span></code> is the assignment identifier. Your instructor will tell you what identifier to use, but you can also see the list of possible assignment ids by running <cite>chisubmit student assignment list</cite>.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;commit-sha&gt;</span></code> is the SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to submit.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the command could look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>chisubmit student assignment submit borja pa1 4eac77c9f11dfb101dbbbe3e9f2df07c40f9b2f5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will be given an opportunity to verify the details of the submission before you actually submit your code. For example, the above command would print something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>You are going to make a submission for pa1 (Programming Assignment 1).
The commit you are submitting is the following:

      Commit: 4eac77c9f11dfb101dbbbe3e9f2df07c40f9b2f5

<p>Before you type &#8220;y&#8221;, <strong>take a moment to ensure that this commit is the one you actually want to submit</strong>. If the commit message and date shown by chisubmit don&#8217;t look right, then you should double-check whether you were able to successfully commit and push your code.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that the above has to be run <em>before the deadline</em>. If you fail to do so, it doesn&#8217;t matter if your code was pushed to the GitLab server before the deadline. For your code to be accepted for grading, you must also run the <cite>chisubmit</cite> submission command before the deadline. The <cite>chisubmit</cite> system will mercilessly stop accepting submissions once the deadline has passed.</p>

<p>Like your first submission, you can only re-submit <em>before the deadline</em>. Once the deadline passes, you cannot modify your submission.</p>
<div class="section" id="making-a-safety-submission">
<h3>Making a safety submission<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-safety-submission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Take into account that chisubmit allows you to make multiple submissions before the deadline. A good strategy is to always make a &#8220;safety submission&#8221; well ahead of the deadline. That way, if you end up missing the deadline, there is already a submission in the system with most of your work on it.</p>
